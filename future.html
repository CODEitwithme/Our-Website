     Whenever I think of the future, one thing is common,
and it's you, my love 😘. I don't want a fancy life;
I want you in my life. In the mornings, I'll be
making breakfast for you, waking you up, and we'll
do exercises together 😜. I'll be there to motivate
you, even if it means pushing you a little harder.
After our morning routine, we'll both head to our
respective jobs. I'll wait for you in the car,
and you'll always take your time. Every day I
will be telling you "Yar time var ye ki parat
ushir hoil". Then I will drop you at your
workplace with a hug and a goodbye 😘.
Then, after a hectic day, I'll come to pick you
up with an ice cream 🍦 and a big smile after
seeing you 🙈. We'll enjoy it in the car as we
head home. We'll cook dinner together, have
some fun, and maybe go for a long walk, putting
our phones aside to discuss our day or watch
something we love. And if there's a cricket
match, we'll watch it together, with me explaining
the game to you 🏏. Finally, we'll end the day
with a good night's sleep 😜🤩. On weekends, we'll
travel wherever you want, and we'll have fun.
Even if we argue a lot, our love will never fade;
it's as vast as the ocean.
 Love you, yar 😘.
